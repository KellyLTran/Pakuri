# Pakuri

Functionality:
Users are greeted with a welcome message and are prompted to specify the Pakudex's maximum capacity.
Users can add new Pakuri species to the Pakudex, view details of existing ones, or evolve them to enhance their attributes.
Users can also retrieve detailed statistics, including its attack, defense, and speed values.
The Pakudex offers a listing feature that shows all the Pakuri in the user's collection.

Program Structure: 
pakuri_program.py: Handles the user interface, taking inputs for different actions and displaying the corresponding results.
pakuri.py: Details Pakuri species and attributes and includes methods for getting and setting these details, and evolving the Pakuri.
pakudex.py: Holds all the Pakuri objects and manages the collection, allowing for the addition of new Pakuri, retrieving statistics, sorting, and evolving creatures in the Pakudex.
